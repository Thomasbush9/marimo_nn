# Neural Network in Pytorch with Marimo

The goal of this repository is to show how marimo can enhance the current jupyter notebook setup when it comes to build a NN model and train it.

Specifically the focus will be:

1. Create a better visualisation of the training loop
2. Better native visualization of the results
3. Ability to run as a script
